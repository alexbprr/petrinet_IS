abstract="The tool Snoopy provides a unifying Petri net framework which has particularly many application scenarios in systems and synthetic biology. The framework consists of two levels: uncoloured and coloured. Each level comprises a family of related Petri net classes, sharing structure, but being specialized by their kinetic information. Petri nets of all net classes within one level can be converted into each other, while changing the level involves user-guided folding or automatic unfolding. Models can be hierarchically structured, allowing for the mastering of larger networks. Snoopy supports the simultaneous use of several Petri net classes; the graphical user interface adapts dynamically to the active one. Built-in animation and simulation (depending on the net class) are complemented by export to various analysis tools. Snoopy facilitates the extension by new Petri net classes thanks to its generic design.",
